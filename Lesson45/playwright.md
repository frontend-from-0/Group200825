# Integration & E2E testing with Playwright (Next.js)


```
        /\
       /  \      E2E              ← Playwright
      /----\
     /      \    Integration      ← Playwright / Jest + RTL
    /--------\
   /          \  Unit + snapshot  ← Jest + RTL (React Testing Library)
  /------------\
```

- **Unit** — one function or component, no I/O. Fast (ms), many.
- **Integration** — multiple modules wired together: a page + its server action, a route handler + the DB, a form + its validation. Slower, fewer.
- **End-to-end (E2E)** — a real browser driving the running app like a real user. Slowest, fewest, highest confidence.

In modern Next.js the line between integration and E2E blurs because server components, server actions, and route handlers all execute inside one running app. Playwright is good at **both**: it boots a real browser, hits the real dev server, and lets us stub only the parts we don't want to talk to (Stripe, Auth0, Vercel Blob).

## Why Playwright (vs Cypress, Selenium)

- Multi-browser out of the box: Chromium, Firefox, WebKit.
- Built-in **auto-waiting** — no `sleep(500)`, no flaky tests.
- Parallel execution by default.
- First-class TypeScript.
- Killer tooling: **UI mode**, **trace viewer**, **codegen**, **Inspector**.
- Officially recommended by Next.js for E2E. See [Next.js + Playwright guide](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/guides/testing/playwright).

## Setup in this project

Run from `Lesson45/ecom-200625/`:

```bash
npm init playwright@latest
```

Pick:

- TypeScript (yes)
- `e2e` as the tests folder
- GitHub Actions workflow (yes, optional)
- Install browsers (yes)

That creates:

```
e2e/                       ← your test files live here
playwright.config.ts       ← config: browsers, baseURL, webServer
.github/workflows/playwright.yml
```

Open `playwright.config.ts` and set the **webServer** + **baseURL** so Playwright boots the Next.js dev server on the right port for you. This app runs on **port 3000** (see `package.json`):

```ts
import { defineConfig, devices } from '@playwright/test';

export default defineConfig({
  testDir: './e2e',
  fullyParallel: true,
  use: {
    baseURL: 'http://localhost:3000',
    trace: 'on-first-retry',
  },
  webServer: {
    command: 'npm run dev',
    url: 'http://localhost:3000',
    reuseExistingServer: !process.env.CI,
    timeout: 120_000,
  },
  projects: [
    { name: 'chromium', use: { ...devices['Desktop Chrome'] } },
  ],
});
```

Docs: [Test configuration](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-configuration), [Web server](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-webserver).

If browsers were not installed at init time:

```bash
npx playwright install
```

---

## Commands you will use today

| Command | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `npx playwright test` | Run all tests (headless). |
| `npx playwright test e2e/home.spec.ts` | Run one file. |
| `npx playwright test --headed` | Watch the browser do the thing. |
| `npx playwright test --ui` | **UI mode** — time-travel debugger. Use this most of the day. |
| `npx playwright test --debug` | Open Playwright Inspector, step through. |
| `npx playwright test --grep "checkout"` | Run only tests whose title matches. |
| `npx playwright codegen http://localhost:3000` | Record clicks → generate test code. |
| `npx playwright show-report` | Open the last HTML report. |
| `npx playwright show-trace trace.zip` | Open a saved trace. |

Add a script to `package.json` after `npm init playwright@latest` so it feels at home next to `npm test`:

```json
"scripts": {
  "test:e2e": "playwright test",
  "test:e2e:ui": "playwright test --ui"
}
```

These scripts are not in the starter repo — add them during setup.

## Anatomy of a Playwright test

```ts
import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';

test('homepage shows featured products', async ({ page }) => {
  await page.goto('/');
  await expect(page.getByRole('heading', { name: /featured electronics/i })).toBeVisible();
});
```

Same `describe` / `it` / `expect` muscle memory as Jest, but with extra Playwright-specific superpowers:

- `page` is a **fixture** — Playwright injects a fresh browser tab for every test.
- `expect(locator).toBe...()` assertions are **web-first**: Playwright retries them until they pass or time out. No manual waiting.

Docs: [Writing tests](https://playwright.dev/docs/writing-tests), [Test fixtures](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-fixtures).

---

## Locators (how you find things on the page)

Always prefer **user-facing** locators in this order:

1. `page.getByRole('button', { name: 'Buy now' })` — accessibility role.
2. `page.getByLabel('Product title')` — for form fields.
3. `page.getByPlaceholder('e.g. Orbit Wireless Earbuds')`.
4. `page.getByText('403')`.
5. `page.getByTestId('go-home-link')` — last resort; we already have one on the forbidden page (`data-testid="go-home-link"`).

Avoid CSS / XPath selectors unless nothing else works. They break when designers tweak Tailwind classes.

Docs: [Locators](https://playwright.dev/docs/locators).

---

## Assertions you will actually use

```ts
await expect(page).toHaveURL('/forbidden');
await expect(page).toHaveTitle(/VoltHaus/);

await expect(locator).toBeVisible();
await expect(locator).toBeHidden();
await expect(locator).toHaveText('403');
await expect(locator).toContainText('Featured');
await expect(locator).toHaveAttribute('href', '/');
await expect(locator).toBeEnabled();
await expect(locator).toBeDisabled();

await expect(page.locator('article')).toHaveCount(8);
```

Docs: [Assertions](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-assertions).

---

## Handling authentication in tests

Admin routes (`/admin/*`) call `requireAdmin()` — they need a real Auth0 session with the **`admin` role** in the token claim. Logging in through the Auth0 Universal Login page on every test is slow, flaky, and hits the public internet. Don't do that.

Playwright's recommended pattern is **`storageState`**: log in once, save the browser cookies to disk, and reuse them across tests. See [Authentication](https://playwright.dev/docs/auth).

### 1. Create a dedicated test user in Auth0

Use a **separate Auth0 account** for E2E — never your personal login.

1. In the Auth0 Dashboard, create a user (e.g. `e2e-admin@yourdomain.test`) with a known password.
2. Assign the **`admin` role** to that user.
3. Make sure your local `.env.local` has the Auth0 block configured (`AUTH0_DOMAIN`, `AUTH0_CLIENT_ID`, `AUTH0_CLIENT_SECRET`, `AUTH0_SECRET`, `APP_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000`). See [`env.example.md`](ecom-130625/env.example.md).

For CI you can store the credentials as secrets (e.g. `E2E_ADMIN_EMAIL`, `E2E_ADMIN_PASSWORD`) if you later automate login in a `globalSetup` script. For local development, saving a session file once is simpler.

### 2. Save an admin session once

Start the dev server, then run codegen and log in as your test admin user when the Auth0 page opens. Playwright saves the session cookies when you close codegen:

```bash
npm run dev
# in another terminal:
npx playwright codegen http://localhost:3000/admin/products --save-storage=e2e/.auth/admin.json
```

After login you should land on `/admin/products`. Close codegen — `e2e/.auth/admin.json` is created.

That file is **gitignored** (`/e2e/.auth/` in `.gitignore`). Each developer creates it locally; never commit session cookies.

### 3. Wire up `playwright.config.ts`

Add a **setup project** that validates the saved session before admin tests run, and point the browser project at the saved cookies:

```ts
import { defineConfig, devices } from '@playwright/test';

export default defineConfig({
  testDir: './e2e',
  fullyParallel: true,
  use: {
    baseURL: 'http://localhost:3000',
    trace: 'on-first-retry',
  },
  webServer: {
    command: 'npm run dev',
    url: 'http://localhost:3000',
    reuseExistingServer: !process.env.CI,
    timeout: 120_000,
  },
  projects: [
    // Runs first — fails fast if the session is missing, expired, or not admin.
    { name: 'setup', testMatch: /auth\.setup\.ts/ },

    // Admin / authenticated tests reuse the saved session.
    {
      name: 'chromium',
      use: {
        ...devices['Desktop Chrome'],
        storageState: 'e2e/.auth/admin.json',
      },
      dependencies: ['setup'],
      testIgnore: /auth\.setup\.ts/,
    },

    // Optional: public / logged-out tests without cookies.
    {
      name: 'chromium-logged-out',
      use: { ...devices['Desktop Chrome'] },
      testMatch: /logged-out\.spec\.ts/,
    },
  ],
});
```

The repo includes `e2e/auth.setup.ts` — it checks that `admin.json` exists, opens `/admin/products`, and confirms you are not redirected to `/forbidden` or Auth0 login.

### 4. Write tests against the saved session

Admin tests start already logged in — no login steps in the test body:

```ts
import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';

test('admin products page loads', async ({ page }) => {
  await page.goto('/admin/products');
  await expect(page.getByRole('heading', { name: 'Products' })).toBeVisible();
});
```

To test **logged-out** behaviour in the same file, opt out of the saved session for that test:

```ts
test.use({ storageState: { cookies: [], origins: [] } });

test('admin route redirects when logged out', async ({ page }) => {
  await page.goto('/admin');
  await expect(page).not.toHaveURL('/admin');
});
```

Or put logged-out tests in a separate spec matched by the `chromium-logged-out` project above.

### 5. When the session expires

Auth0 sessions expire. If admin tests suddenly redirect to Auth0 or `/forbidden`, refresh the file:

```bash
npx playwright codegen http://localhost:3000/admin/products --save-storage=e2e/.auth/admin.json
```

`auth.setup.ts` prints a clear error when this happens so you know to re-run codegen.

### 6. CI

Two common approaches:

| Approach | How | Trade-off |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Saved session secret** | Base64-encode `e2e/.auth/admin.json`, store as a GitHub Actions secret, restore it before `playwright test`. Refresh the secret when the session expires. | Simple; manual refresh |
| **Programmatic login** | `globalSetup` reads `E2E_ADMIN_EMAIL` / `E2E_ADMIN_PASSWORD` from CI secrets, fills the Auth0 login form once, writes `admin.json`. | More setup; self-healing on each run |

Either way: use the **test user**, stub Stripe/Blob in tests, and keep session files out of git.

### Quick checklist

- [ ] Auth0 test user exists with **`admin` role**
- [ ] `e2e/.auth/admin.json` saved locally via codegen
- [ ] `playwright.config.ts` has `setup` + `storageState` projects
- [ ] Admin tests do **not** call Auth0 login in the test body
- [ ] Logged-out tests explicitly clear `storageState`
- [ ] Session file is **not** committed

## Real flows we will test in this app

### 1. Public homepage (pure E2E smoke test)

```ts
import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';

test('homepage lists all 8 featured products', async ({ page }) => {
  await page.goto('/');

  await expect(
    page.getByRole('heading', { name: /featured electronics/i }),
  ).toBeVisible();

  await expect(page.locator('article')).toHaveCount(8);

  await expect(
    page.getByRole('heading', { name: 'Aether ANC Headphones' }),
  ).toBeVisible();
});
```

### 2. Forbidden page (deterministic E2E)

Compare this with the snapshot test from lesson 1 — same intent, very different confidence.

```ts
test('forbidden page links back home', async ({ page }) => {
  await page.goto('/forbidden');

  await expect(page.getByText('403')).toBeVisible();
  await expect(page.getByTestId('go-home-link')).toHaveAttribute('href', '/');
});
```

### 3. Admin products — lesson exercise

**Test A — validation:** open `/admin/products/new`, submit the empty form, and assert the Zod error messages appear in the UI (`Product title is required.`, `Upload at least one image.`).

**Test B — create + list:** fill in title, price, and an image file, save, land on `/admin/products`, and assert the new product row is visible (title, price, thumbnail).

Hints:

- The form is behind `requireAdmin()`. Use `storageState` with a saved admin session (see [Handling authentication in tests](#handling-authentication-in-tests) above).
- Prefer `getByLabel('Product title')`, `getByLabel('Price')`, `getByLabel('Image files')`, and `getByRole('button', { name: /save product/i })`.
- Use `setInputFiles()` for the image upload. Put a small fixture under `e2e/fixtures/`.
- Clean up test products from MongoDB in `afterEach` / `finally` so reruns stay reliable.

### 4. Checkout — network interception (no real Stripe call)

We never want CI to spend money. Intercept the POST and assert the request payload.

```ts
test('Buy now posts the right price id to /api/checkout', async ({ page }) => {
  await page.route('**/api/checkout/', async (route) => {
    const request = route.request();
    const post = request.postData() ?? '';
    expect(post).toContain('price_1TLopAQitHtctVUTDOFoUqz7');
    await route.fulfill({ status: 200, body: 'ok' });
  });

  await page.goto('/');
  await page
    .locator('article')
    .first()
    .getByRole('button', { name: /buy now/i })
    .click({ force: true });
});
```

Docs: [Network mocking](https://playwright.dev/docs/network), [`page.route`](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-page#page-route).

### 5. Auth-gated route (logged out)

Visiting `/admin` while logged out gets you bounced. Clear `storageState` for this test (see [Handling authentication in tests](#handling-authentication-in-tests)):

```ts
test.use({ storageState: { cookies: [], origins: [] } });

test('admin route is gated', async ({ page }) => {
  await page.goto('/admin');
  await expect(page).not.toHaveURL('/admin');
});
```

---

## Stubbing the world (so CI is reliable)

Three things in this repo touch the outside world. Stub them all in tests:

- **Stripe** — intercept `**/api/checkout/**` with `page.route()`.
- **Auth0** — use `storageState` with a test-user session (see [Handling authentication in tests](#handling-authentication-in-tests)); do not drive the login UI on every test.
- **Vercel Blob** — intercept the upload, return a fake URL.

Rule of thumb: **never let a test reach the public internet**.

---

## Debugging tools

- **UI mode** (`--ui`) — pick a test, step through, see the DOM at every point. Start here.
- **Inspector** (`--debug`) — pauses on each step, you control the next action.
- **Trace viewer** — every retried/failed test saves a `trace.zip`. Open it with `npx playwright show-trace trace.zip` — full timeline, screenshots, network, console.
- **HTML report** — `npx playwright show-report` after a run.
- **Codegen** (`codegen <url>`) — click around the app, Playwright writes the locator code for you. Great for getting unstuck.

## Best practices (read [the official one](https://playwright.dev/docs/best-practices))

- One scenario per test. If a test fails you should know **which user flow** broke.
- Prefer role-based locators. Treat `data-testid` as a fallback.
- Never use `page.waitForTimeout(ms)`. Wait for **state**, not time.
- Keep tests independent — no shared cookies / localStorage between them unless you opt in.
- Reset DB state between tests when you write integration tests that hit Prisma.
- Use **storageState** for login. Don't log in from the UI on every test.
- Run on at least Chromium locally + add Firefox/WebKit in CI before release.
