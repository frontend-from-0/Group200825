      <h1>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)</h1>

            The very first thing we need to do is to tell the HTML document that
            we have some CSS rules we want it to use. There are three different
            ways to apply CSS to an HTML document that you'll commonly come
            across â€” external stylesheets, internal stylesheets, and inline
            styles. Let's look at these now. If you are working through this
            article using the MDN Playground, you won't be able to follow the
            steps detailed in this section in the same way as people writing the
            code on their local computers. This is because MDN Playground
            handles adding the CSS to the HTML implicitly in the background. You
            should however still read through the section to be aware of the
            content.

            An external stylesheet contains CSS in a separate file with a .css
            extension. This is the most common and useful method of bringing CSS
            to a document. You can link a single CSS file to multiple web pages,
            styling all of them with the same CSS stylesheet. Create a file in
            the same folder as your HTML document and save it as styles.css.
